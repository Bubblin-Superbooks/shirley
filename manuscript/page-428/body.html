It was a still nightâ€”calm, dewy, cloudless; the gables, turned to the west, reflected the clear amber of the horizon they faced; the oaks behind were black; the cedar was blacker. Under its dense, raven boughs a glimpse of sky opened gravely blue. It was full of the moon, which  looked solemnly and mildly down on Caroline from beneath that sombre canopy.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">She felt this night and prospect mournfully lovely. She wished she could be happy; she wished she could know inward peace; she wondered Providence had no pity on her, and would not help or console her.</p></div> </div>
