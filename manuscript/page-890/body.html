<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>"I mean to make a way to do so, if one is not made for me. I cannot live always in Briarfield. The whole world is not very large compared with creation. I must see the outside of our own round planet, at least."</p><p>"How much of its outside?"</p><p>"First this hemisphere where we live; then the other. I am resolved that my life shall be a life. Not a black trance like the toad's, buried in marble; nor a long, slow death like yours in Briarfield rectory."</p><p>"Like mine! what can you mean, child?"</p><p>"Might you not as well be tediously dying as for ever shut up in that glebe-houseâ€”a place that, when I pass it, always reminds me of a windowed grave? I never see any movement about the door. I never hear a sound from the wall. I believe smoke never issues from the chimneys. What do you do there?"</p><p>"I sew, I read, I learn lessons."</p><p>"Are you happy?"</p></div> </div>
