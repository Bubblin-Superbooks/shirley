He takes no warning from the fate of Pearson, nor from that of Armitage—shot, one in his own house and the other on the moor."</p><p>"But he should take warning, sir, and use precautions too," interposed Mr. Sweeting; "and I think he would if he heard what I heard the other day."</p><p>"What did you hear, Davy?"</p><p>"You know Mike Hartley, sir?"</p><p>"The Antinomian weaver? Yes."</p></div> </div>
