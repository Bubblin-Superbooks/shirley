Her voice once drowned by the shout of ruffian defiance, and I shall be full of impulses to resist and quell.

Let them meddle with Robert, or Robert's mill, or Robert's interests, and I shall hate them. At present I am no patrician, nor do I regard the poor around me as plebeians; but if once they violently wrong me or mine, and then presume to dictate to us, I shall quite forget pity for their wretchedness and respect for their poverty, in scorn of their ignorance and wrath at their insolence."</p><p>"Shirley, how your eyes flash!"</p></div> </div>
