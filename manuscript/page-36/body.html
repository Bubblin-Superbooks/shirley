Mike says he even likes to talk to him and run after him, but he has a <em>hankering</em> that Moore should be made an example of. He was extolling him to Mr. Hall the other day as the mill-owner with the most brains in Yorkshire, and for that reason he affirms Moore should be chosen as a sacrifice, an oblation of a sweet savour. Is Mike Hartley in his right mind, do you think, sir?" inquired Sweeting simply.</p><p>"Can't tell, Davy. He may be crazed, or he may be only crafty, or perhaps a little of both."</p><p>"He talks of seeing visions, sir."</p><p>"Ay! He is a very Ezekiel or Daniel for visions. He came just when I was going to bed last Friday night to describe one that had been revealed to him in Nunnely Park that very afternoon."</p><p>"Tell it, sir. What was it?" urged Sweeting.</p></div> </div>
