Here is the placeâ€”green sod and a gray marble headstone. Jessy sleeps below. She lived through an April day; much loved was she, much loving. She often, in her brief life, shed tears, she had frequent sorrows; she smiled between, gladdening whatever saw her.

The dying and the watching English girls were at  that hour alone in a foreign country, and the soil of that country gave Jessy a grave.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Now, behold Rose two years later. The crosses and garlands looked strange, but the hills and woods of this landscape look still stranger.
