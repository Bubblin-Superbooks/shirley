The road over the fields is as safe, silent, and solitary as a path through the air would be. Will you go?"</p><p>"Yes," was the answer, given mechanically, not because the speaker wished or was prepared to go, or, indeed, was otherwise than scared at the prospect of going, but because she felt she could not abandon Shirley.</p><p>"Then we must fasten up these windows, and leave all as secure as we can behind us. Do you know what we are going for, Cary?"</p></div> </div>
