<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>"Should I be happy wandering alone in strange countries as you wish to do?"</p><p>"Much happier, even if you did nothing but wander. Remember, however, that I shall have an object in view; but if you only went on and on, like some enchanted lady in a fairy tale, you might be happier than now. In a day's wandering you would pass many a hill, wood, and watercourse, each perpetually altering in aspect as the sun shone out or was overcast; as the weather was wet or fair, dark or bright. Nothing changes in Briarfield rectory. The plaster of the parlour ceilings, the paper on the walls, the curtains, carpets, chairs, are still the same."</p><p>"Is change necessary to happiness?"</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>"Is it synonymous with it?"</p><p>"I don't know; but I feel monotony and death to be almost the same."</p><p>Here Jessie spoke.</p></div> </div>
