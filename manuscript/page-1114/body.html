That day she had not been riding out; she had evidently passed it quietly. She wore her neat indoor dress and silk apron. This was no Thalestris from the fields, but a quiet domestic character from the fireside. Mr. Moore had her at advantage. He should have addressed her at once in solemn accents, and with rigid mien. Perhaps he would, had she looked saucy; but her air never showed less of <em>crânerie</em>. A soft kind of youthful shyness depressed her eyelid and mantled on her cheek. The tutor stood silent.</p><p>She made a full stop between the door and his desk.</p><p>"Did you want me, sir?" she asked.</p><p>"I ventured, Miss Keeldar, to send for you—that is, to ask an interview of a few minutes."</p><p>She waited; she plied her needle.</p><p>"Well, sir" (not lifting her eyes), "what about?"</p></div> </div>
