Is she coming this morning?"</p><p>"She will come at ten, as usual, to take her French lesson."</p><p>"You don't find that she sneers at you, do you?"</p><p>"She does not. She appreciates me better than any one else here; but then she has more intimate opportunities of knowing me. She sees that I have education, intelligence, manner, principlesâ€”all, in short, which belongs to a person well born and well bred."</p><p>"Are you at all fond of her?"</p><p>"For <em>fond</em> I cannot say. I am not one who is prone to take violent fancies, and, consequently, my friendship is the more to be depended on. I have a regard for her as my relative; her position also inspires interest, and her conduct as my pupil has hitherto been such as rather to enhance than diminish the attachment that springs from other causes."</p></div> </div>
