<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>"What, madam—<em>what</em> could be your reasons for refusing Sir Philip?"</p><p>"At last there is another sensible question; I shall be glad to reply to it. Sir Philip is too young for me. I regard him as a boy. All his relations—his mother especially—would be annoyed if he married me. Such a step would embroil him with them. I am not his equal in the world's estimation."</p><p>"Is that all?"</p><p>"Our dispositions are not compatible."</p><p>"Why, a more amiable gentleman never breathed."</p><p>"He is very amiable—very excellent—truly estimable; but _not my master_—not in one point. I could not trust myself with his happiness. I would not undertake the keeping of it for thousands. I will accept no hand which cannot hold me in check."</p><p>"I thought you liked to do as you please. You are vastly inconsistent."</p></div> </div>
