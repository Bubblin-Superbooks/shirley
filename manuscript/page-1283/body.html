I am at present responsible for his life; it shall not be forfeited for half an hour's idle gossip.' But I must not tell you all she said; it was very disagreeable. However, we came yet againâ€”mamma, Miss Keeldar, and I. This time we thought we should conquer, as we were three against one, and Shirley was on our side. But Mrs. Yorke opened such a battery."</p><p>Moore smiled. "What did she say?"</p><p>"Things that astonished us. Shirley laughed at last; I cried; mamma was seriously annoyed.
