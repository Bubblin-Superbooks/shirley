My note last night informed you that Barraclough's trial had ended in his conviction and sentence to transportation. His associates will plot vengeance. I shall lay my plans so as to counteract or at least be prepared for theirsâ€”that is all. Having now given you as clear an explanation as I can, am I to understand that for what I propose doing I have your approbation?"</p><p>"I shall stand by you so long as you remain on the defensive. Yes."</p></div> </div>
