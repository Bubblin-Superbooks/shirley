She is a child."</p><p>"She is eighteen, or at least seventeen—old enough to know all about gowns, petticoats, and chaussures."</p><p>"Do not spoil Caroline, I entreat you, brother. Do not make her of more consequence than she ought to be. At present she is modest and unassuming: let us keep her so."</p></div> </div>
